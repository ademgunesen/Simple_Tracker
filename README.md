# Simple_Tracker
A simple object tracking filter algorithm. Uses box coordinates of the target object in first frame to get an initial filter. The filter evolves in time to get detect the object better. Each successive detection updates the filter. Detections occured past in the times has low weight and effect in the future filters and eventually their effect dies out. Using the assumption that movement is continuos across the succesive frames, the next position of the object can be estimated. Therefore we can reduce our search space to narrower space which in turn enables us to achieve higher FPS.
